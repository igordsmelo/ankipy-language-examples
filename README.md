# anki-language-samples

A simple library with the purpose of adding examples (in text and audio) to Anki cards.

It uses [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org)'s database text files as the source for the phrases to be added to your cards.


This script requires AnkiConnect to be set up and Anki to be running on the background.

If this code is useful to you, consider contributing to Tatoeba.
